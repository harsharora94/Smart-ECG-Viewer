# SmartCOM - Enabling remote Electrophysiology  

## Overview:
Everyday hundreds of electrophysiology related procedures happen all across globe. However, there are limited numbers of expert electrophysiologists available across the world to physically diagnose and treat patients. Most of the times, the experts are consulted over phone during the procedure for the right treatment. The quality of the solution provided depends on the quality of verbal communication of the scenario. There is a high probability of mis-diagnosis and improper solution. In addition to it, it results in increased procedure duration thereby causing patient discomfort and reduced hospital productivity.
